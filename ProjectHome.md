This mod allows a new style of gaming to be played throughout the source games. It's an open source project which adds an RPG Levelling style game play to FPS.

Players gain levels by doing certain activities such as planting bombs etc. Gaining levels gives them access to upgrade skills which are separately programmed using the SourceRPG's main API and loaded.
